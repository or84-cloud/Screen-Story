        <p>William Morrison (Aneurin Barnard) is a depressed young writer who only thinks of death and killing himself. A chance encounter, when trying for the umpteenth time to commit suicide, with an aging assassin on the brink of retirement, Leslie O'Neil, as played by, Tom Wilkinson, results in him hiring the aged assassin. Leslie promises to fulfill the contract within the week, but when William receives a call from a publisher saying they are interested in his book, a meeting with one of the company’s editor’s, Ellie Adams (Freya Mavor), has him rethinking his desires to die. But for Leslie, a contract is a contract. After all, he must meet his quota.</p>
        <p>With his feature film debut, writer and director Tom Edmunds with cinematographer Luke Bryant deliver a little masterpiece, which convinces with an absurd story and on point dialogues of nihilism, death and love.</p>

        </div>

        <p>In the moment when Leslie pulls out a brochure of options that William has for his death, the comedic side of the movie takes place. It's the juxtaposition between the darkness, the fact that William is someone who often tries to get himself killed and the almost happy nature of O'Neil when he explains what he does for a living. By doing this, Leslie's role changes from a seemingly awkward older man to a grim reaper of sorts, a now gentle harbinger of death despite only being able to afford a quick and painless death than the "Heroes Death" to make William seem like a valiant martyr. It seems weird, almost humiliating that this was the only death he could afford.</p>

        <p>Upon his wish for a hero's death, caused by pushing a child away from a moving truck, William finds out that the only death he can afford is to be in the crosshairs of Leslie's gun for a quick and painless death for two thousand pounds. It seems weird, almost humiliating, that this was the only death available in his budget.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the contract is signed and the deal is set in stone.</p>

        <h2>The Final Reckoning</h2>

        <p>Toward the end of the film, set in the small cottage outside of London, Leslie offers no easy resolutions, only the confirmation that William must die. But to the viewer's shock, William confesses that he now has something to live for—love. Simultaneously, the contract still needed to be met, along with the growing pressure from Harvey, the unpleasant head of the shady Guild of Assassins, and as far as he's concerned, the contract is binding.

            Previously, Ivan, the younger Eastern European hitman, is assigned to kill Leslie after their disagreement in their office and starts off his search by breaking into his home to find that neither he nor his wife is home. Once he continues on Leslie's trail, he finds them in the cottage bickering about what is to happen. This leaves the trio to decide on killing Ivan and having him take William's place as the end-all be-all to let everyone win. The concept of this ending almost reminds me about the kind of person Albert Camus is said to be, that his work is for those who enjoy a more nihilistic outlook on life for the reason that it deals with depressing (or dull) topics by ramming into them like an angered goat.</p>

        <blockquote>
            Dead in a Week or Your Money Back is a rare film that cradles a gentle balance between humor and death, something only a few films succeed in.
        </blockquote>

        <p></p>

        <p>In a summation of what the film is or is meant to be, Dead in a Week or Your Money Back appeals to most, but with the twists and turns of our characters, you'll enjoy the fact that the central character has hired an assassin to kill him in one week (or get his money back.) Whilst the subject matter of the film is about suicide, the film promotes merely one simple truth.</p>
        <p>Life is precious.</p>
