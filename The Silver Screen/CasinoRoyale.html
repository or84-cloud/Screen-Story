        <p>Barely reined in by MI6, James Bond, the cold-blooded Agent 007, embarks on his dangerous first assignment to track down sly banker Le Chiffre, the underworld's preferred chief financier. Now, after losing tons of his international terrorist clients' money, Le Chiffre is hell-bent on winning it all back at a marathon high-stakes poker game at the Casino Royale in Montenegro, unaware that Bond is determined to bankrupt the greedy banker at the card table. However, as the nerve-racking Texas hold 'em tournament ratchets up the tension, James Bond will soon find himself in a tight spot as Le Chiffre is a force to reckon with. But is he capable of stopping Bond, the agent with, literally, a licence to Kill </p>

            "The most devastating part of action films aren't about kick-ass scenes filled with utmost badassery, but about the serenity suspended in amber."

        <h2>The Architecture of Almost</h2>

        <p>The film's genius lies in its shifting tides of loyalty. Bond's denouncing of her after her death, stating, "The job's done and the bitch is dead." could have been written as a sign of a broken and twisted heart after her, and Mathis' betrayal, but M grants him the dignity of his own perspective, allowing for a breath of grief. In the gutting scene, he articulates the particular loneliness of loving someone who exists another life, another once was person, the kind that you only dream of once was.</p>

        <p>After earning a licence to kill, secret agent James Bond sets out on his first mission as 007. Bond must defeat a private banker funding terrorists in a high-stakes game of poker at Casino Royale, in Montenegro.<p>

        <h2>A "Double-Crossed" Ending</h2>

        <p>Vesper’s double cross and subsequent martyrdom is cinematic and emotional: a tragic ending only equaled by On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1968). But I’m still a little disillusioned by the cliffhanger ending. The entangled backstory of villains was already hard to keep track of, and now we’re expected to pay even closer attention in subsequent films. In revealing a larger conspiracy, Casino Royale compassionately renders the dynamic duo in a tender spot, causing Bond to almost soften after what seems like a great wound has been healed.</p>
        <blockquote>
            "This new entry in the Bond series is a fresh look at the "new" Bond. One that bewitches the mind and ensnares the senses. Casino Royale is a new take on the story, sans exploding fireballs a once staple to the series.
        </blockquote>

        <p>What makes Campbell's achievement so remarkable is how he's made a film that's changed what it's meant to be 007, while being almost calm about the entire debacle. The film understands the strains of being an MI6 agent, one with a license to, literally, kill (and do so in style).</p>

        <p>Connery's 007 in 1963 From Russia With Love set the benchmark for the definitive fully fledged Bond, Craig's is the most impressive all out performance of any actor in the series to date and hints at a bright future for this enduring character.</p>
